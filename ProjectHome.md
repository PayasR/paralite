ParaLite is a shared-nothing parallel database based on a popular open-source database software SQLite. It extends SQL syntax to integrate arbitrary command lines, which we hereafter call “User-Deﬁned eXecutable (UDX)”. The intended applications are data intensive workﬂows, typically built out of various independently developed executables and scripts. ParaLite is easy to use due to its server-less and zero-configuration features.
